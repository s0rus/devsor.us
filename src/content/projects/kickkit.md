Web extension for the browser which I created with friend of mine. It's a tool that enhances chatting and viewing experience on streaming platform [kick.com](https://https://kick.com/). It uses some simple DOM manipulation to add some new features like:

- **hiding some UI elements that user might find annoying**
- **displaying information about videos directly in the chat**
- **displaying images directly in the chat**

You can check it in action through the demo link above.
