This repository contains all the projects I've done while learning web development on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It is a free online curriculum that teaches you web development with JavaScript. It is a great place to start if you want to learn web development... and so I did! With this course my journey of frontend development started for good and I'm not stopping anytime soon.
