Ballot is a really simple and straightforward app that lets you create polls and vote on them.
It was my first go with typescript to familiarize myself with working with it in react environment.

I used the following things to create this app:

- TYPESCRIPT
- REACT
- REACT ROUTER
- STYLED COMPONENTS
- FIREBASE
