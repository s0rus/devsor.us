E-commerce website that I've made to explore newest features of Next 14 and React:

- **Server actions**
- **React Server Components**
- **App router**
- **useFormState hook**
- **useFormStatus hook**

Also, two other things I wanted to try include **uploadthing** for file uploading and **clerk** for auth.
